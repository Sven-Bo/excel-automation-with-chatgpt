# Excel Automation Made Easy with Python and ChatGPT 
In this video, I'm sharing my experience with ChatGPT, an AI tool that helps you automate tasks in Python and Excel. I've been playing around with it over the past few weeks, and I have to say, it's pretty impressive.
In the video, I'll be demonstrating a couple of practical examples of how you can use ChatGPT to make your life easier. Specifically, I'll be showing you how to use ChatGPT to replace certain phrases in multiple Excel files, save each worksheet in a workbook as a new workbook, and filter data in an Excel file by unique values.
For some examples, I'll also be comparing the solution that ChatGPT gives me to the one I came up with in a previous tutorial. This way, you can see the differences and how ChatGPT's solution stacks up.
